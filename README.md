### Hi friends, 👋 I am Alexandros. I am from Greece, based in Berlin. I am a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Physics. I am passionate with coding. My wish is to contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable and green future using my scientific expertise and AI as a tool towards this direction.

Technical skills include Python, Matlab, Mathematica programming for simulations, analytics, and visualization (also: Bash, Git, SQL); Data Analytics with Matplotlib, Seaborn; Basic experience using Docker and AWS Cloud. I am actively searching for a new challenge anywhere in Germany with preference to Berlin.
