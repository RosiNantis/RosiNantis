### Hi folks ðŸ‘‹ I am Alexandros. I am from Greece, currently living in Berlin. I am a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Physics. I am passionate with coding in Python. My wish is to contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable and green future. I am focused in combining my curious-spirit with the scientific expertise, using AI as a tool towards this direction.

Technical skills include Python, Matlab, Mathematica programming for simulations, analytics, and visualization (also: Bash, Git, SQL); Data Analytics with Matplotlib, Seaborn; Basic experience using Docker and AWS Cloud. I am actively searching for a new challenge anywhere in Germany with preference to Berlin.
